This project is composed of three independant parts : the server (Java), the Android app (Android native (Java) and Flutter (Dart)) as well as an admin client (JavaFX (Java)).

Note: this project is still not finished. It works, but it is unstable, not optimized nor fully debugged. This project was mainly used as a "learning project", thanks to which I now have certain skills in Java (see [this project](https://github.com/lvcv4y/data_blockchain/tree/dev) for cleaner Java code) and in Dart. I also learnt Android and Flutter frameworks through this project.

Note 2: The three parts are either Android Studio or Intellij projects. Feel free to import them as [Android Studio](https://maxrohde.com/2014/08/18/import-github-project-to-android-studio/) or [IntelliJ](https://treehozz.com/how-do-i-import-a-project-from-github-to-intellij) project, as it will get significantly easier to navigate and read the code (note for the Android app: you will probably need to [install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) first if you want to import it in Android Studio).
